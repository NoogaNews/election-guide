            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I am the 2014 Constitution Party candidate for Governor of Tennessee.<br><br>I was born and raised in Union City, TN. As a kid, I was challenged by my parents and peers to be all that I could be. As a teenager, I was invited by a friend in high school to go and worship God. I attended worship faithfully for one year hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ ringing in my ears and resting in my soul. In October of 1988, I was born again as a disciple of Jesus Christ. It was this experience that would forever change my life. I continue to sit at the Master's feet to learn and to utilize the talents that He has given me.<br><br>I graduated from Union City High School and proceeded to the University of Tennessee at Martin where I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1995. From there I furthered my studies and obtained my Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.) from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1999.<br><br>After graduating from veterinary school, I began a career as a small animal veterinarian. I have lived and worked in many cities throughout this great state of Tennessee. I have been an associate veterinarian, relief veterinarian, emergency room veterinarian and now an owner of a veterinary hospital.<br><br>I became involved in politics in 2008 after the Banker Bailout Act (i.e. TARP, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) was passed. It was at this point that I realized that the Republican Party for which I championed as the only conservative party was a fraud because they gave 700 billion dollars or more of your money to big failed banks and insurance companies. We heard the term "too big to fail." I know that it was our conservative Republicans that failed us. I am now a member and vice-Chairman of the Constitution Party of Tennessee. As a candidate I am committed to the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Tennessee as well as to our party platform which I hope you will read and consider at www.cpotn.com Unlike the two major parties we hold our elected accountable.</p>

            <h3>Issues</h3>

<p><em>Would you support or oppose an expansion of TennCare under the Affordable Care Act?</em></p>
    <p>1. Against Common Core<br>2. Against Obamacare<br>3. Against Gun Control<br>4. Against Sharia Law<br>5. Against Big Government<br>6. For the Constitution<br>7. For Yes on 1</p>

<p><em>Do you support or oppose more restrictions on abortion in Tennessee?</em></p>
    <p>As a born again Christian, husband, and father of three, I understand that life begins at conception. Therefore no man nor woman has the authority to pass a death sentence on an unborn child. I am pro life.</p>

<p><em>What changes, if any, would you support for the state's Common Core education standards?</em></p>
    <p>Stop Common Core in the state of Tennessee now by getting the federal department of education out of our state's business and return the public schools back to their locally elected school boards. We need to raise educational standards but Common Core will only have the opposite effect.</p>

<p><em>Should the Hall income tax be reduced, repealed or kept in place?</em></p>
    <p>Repealed, let's limit the size of government and not tax anyone's personal income especially when they make good investment decisions.</p>
