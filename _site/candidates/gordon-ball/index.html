            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Gordon Ball (born William Gordon Ball in Cocke County, TN, on January 29, 1949) has been practicing law since 1975 as a licensed Tennessee attorney who focuses on consumer rights and antitrust class actions. Ball graduated from East Tennessee State University (ETSU), Johnson City, TN, in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He received his law degree from the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law at Memphis State University in 1974.<br><br>Ball has been admitted to or appeared before a multitude of federal and state courts across the United States, including the United States Supreme Court, the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. He has appeared in courts in well over half of the States.<br><br>Ball served as an Assistant United States District Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee. In 1977, he served as a delegate and Vice President to Tennessee's last Constitutional Convention. He campaigned for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1978 against Jimmy Quillen, and shortly thereafter, returned to private practice where he specialized in the defense of "white-collar" federal prosecutions.<br><br>For nearly two decades, Ball has been a pioneer in plaintiff's class action lawsuits on behalf of victims of abuse by powerful corporations. Ball has a long record of successfully litigating cases on behalf of both individuals and classes, particularly in cases involving antitrust violations, such as monopolization and price-fixing. Ball's aggregate multi-billion dollar recoveries have included cases against oil companies, telecommunication companies, health care companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, banks, auto manufacturers, record manufacturers, paper manufacturers, vitamin makers, boat manufacturers, stucco manufacturers and supermarket chains.<br><br>Upon settlements in numerous cases in which the presiding court is presented an opportunity to make charitable awards (cy pres awards) to national, regional, state and local charitable organizations, Gordon Ball has been instrumental in seeking the award of residual funds for charities and other institutions, including St. Jude's Hospital, The Wounded Warrior's Project, the United Way, Public Justice, Boys & Girls Clubs, East Tennessee State University, the University of Tennessee Building Fund, and the University of Memphis School of Law.<br><br>Ball is currently campaigning for the Democratic nomination in the 2014 United States Senate race. He is clear on his intentions as a candidate for politicians to serve a term, a maximum of two terms and vacate the office for others to run.<br><br>Education<br><br>Cosby High School, Cocke County, Tennessee<br>East Tennessee State University, B.S.

            <h3>Health care</h3>
    <p><em>What should be done to address the country's health care system?</em></p>
        <p>Everyone deserves healthcare. Back in 1995, I had a heart attack. A month later, I had another one. That was nineteen (19) years ago. I'm healthy now. Of course, the medical bills piled up, but unlike many Americans, I had good health insurance and was also financially able to handle the enormous costs of medical care. However, many American families are financially ruined by catastrophic medical situations, which push them over the economic cliff. In the 21st century, American families should not have to choose between feeding, clothing and sheltering their children, or taking them to the doctor.</p>
    
    <p><em>If you oppose the Affordable Care Act or believe it should be modified, what are some of the alternatives you support?</em></p>
        <p>I'll fight to end the antitrust exemption for health insurance companies regarding the Affordable Care Act &mdash; an exemption that currently allows insurance companies the luxury of not having to compete for business, resulting in higher premiums for American consumers.</p>

<h3>National security</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest threat to national security?</em></p>
        <p>Terrorism, domestic and abroad, is a huge threat and has been since the 1972 Olympics. The biggest long term national security threat is our debt that we owe to china.</p>
    
    <p><em>Should the U.S. play a greater role in international affairs?</em></p>
        <p>We are part of a global community and that is the reality. I would put the oxygen mask on our country first and make sure we are breathing. Think about it, if we had the money back from the Iraq war we could build a school in every county of the country.</p>
    
    <p><em>Do you support or oppose the Obama administration's military strategy against the Islamic State?</em></p>
        <p>I agree with my congressman jimmy Duncan, that appropriate steps were taken and there should be no boots on the ground should be utilized by the US.</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>
    <p><em>How can the U.S. ensure greater energy independence?</em></p>
        <p>Invest in a Manhattan style project for the next 20 years that includes wind, solar, nuclear,and coal and build the keystone pipeline. We must prepare for the generations to come by using all the options available to us.</p>
    
    <p><em>Is climate change a problem? If so, what policies do you support to curb it?</em></p>
        <p>90% of reputable scientist say climate change is a problem, if they are to be believed, we must curb our emissions, but to do so without other industrial countries agreement is senseless.</p>
    
    <hr />

<h3>Immigration</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest issue facing our current immigration system?</em></p>
        <p>We need to secure our borders more probably, and not just the southern border.</p>
    
    <p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
        <p>I do not believe in Amnesty. I do think there needs to be a fair and clear path for immigrants in this country to obtain citizenship and laws are in place to do that, but it needs to also be fair to taxpayers and legal immigrants.</p>
    
    <hr />

<h3>Economy</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest issue facing the U.S. economy?</em></p>
        <p>We have to quit giving tax exemptions to corporations such as the oil industry and Wall Street. And it is imperative that we crack down on wasteful spending.</p>
    
    <p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
        <p>Total restructuring of our tax system, which if properly done could create 1 million good paying jobs to rebuild our infrastructure for the 21st century. This must be a bi-partisan effort.</p>
    
    <p><em>What spending cuts or changes to the tax code are needed to reduce the national debt?</em></p>
        <p>We need a balanced budget.</p>
