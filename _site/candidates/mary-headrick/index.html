            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Physician, former public school math teacher, former computer analyst ORNL, Oak Ridge. Married 39 years, 2 adult sons, 3 grandchildren. Past Board and Committee positions League of Women Voters and American College of Physicians with work for voters' rights and affordable access to healthcare.</p>
            <hr />
        


        
            <h3>Health care</h3>
    <p><em>What should be done to address the country's health care system?</em></p>
        <p>Minor improvements to the patient protection and affordable care act. Modify the 'fee for service' payment system to constrain cost but apply dollars to health services that evidenced based reviews show give valuable results. Continued vigilance for consumer protection in both health insurance and health services.</p>
    
    <p><em>If you oppose the Affordable Care Act or believe it should be modified, what are some of the alternatives you support?</em></p>
        <p>I support the PPACA. However, the formula for denying subsidies to low income individuals who are offered work place insurance is flawed and there is no reason an applicant should be required to have Email. We will need to monitor insurance companies carefully to assure they comply with qualified health plan rules, such as paying for preventive, screening colonoscopies every 10 years. Also, we will need to safeguard 'cherry picking' in which insurance companies will try to push high cost, sicker patients on to the exchange while offering QHPs off of the exchange (in other words privatize profit, publicize risk&#58; the insurance company game)</p>

<h3>National security</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest threat to national security?</em></p>
        <p>Porous borders for both terrorists and disease and porous internet systems. Also, special interests pushing for a 'war economy' instead of a 'peoples' economy'. We can be frightened and pushed into meddling in other countries where we do little good but sacrifice our men and women and our dollars.</p>
    
    <p><em>Should the U.S. play a greater role in international affairs?</em></p>
        <p>We have three ways to interact with the rest of the world&#58; Diplomaticlly (do more when able), Economically (Protect our own economy but use this tool), and with Military (Strive to minimize this). We need a greater Diplomatic and Economic role but a smaller Military role in international affairs.</p>
    
    <p><em>Do you support or oppose the Obama administration's military strategy against the Islamic State?</em></p>
        <p>I oppose the current strategy. Turkey is attacking the Kurds, not ISIL nor ISIS and many Syrian rebels continue Assad attacks rather than ISIL or ISIS. Until the region's own countries have a united 'boots on the ground' in the Middle East, we should not bomb nor man nor arm the area. We cannot distinguish our enemies and friends in this 1300 year mess of Sunni against Shia against Kurd...etc. Without that distinction, you cannot aim the $1.5 Million eash Tomahawk missile.</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>
    <p><em>How can the U.S. ensure greater energy independence?</em></p>
        <p>We must not harvest our own fossil fuels as quickly as possible and ship them overseas. We must use them ourselves, slowly and gradually while implementing&#58; renewable energy like wind and solar, efficient energy like higher MPG vehicles and mass transit and more sustainable water movement, food production, housing and lives. There IS man-made climate change due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels. We need a national energy policy. We need dillegence because, e.g. Koch, the oil refining billionaire will 'bad-mouth' his competitor&#58; Wind.</p>
    
    <p><em>Is climate change a problem? If so, what policies do you support to curb it?</em></p>
        <p>See my response to Energy. Special Interests like the KOCH brothers are perverting the message and hiding the truth. Carbon dioxide is a waste product that is changing our atmosphere and climate because we have been burning fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. Let us strive for energy independence, not only from the Middle East, but also from the Oil and Gas industry, a BIG special interest that does not have our long term interests at heart.</p>

<h3>Immigration</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest issue facing our current immigration system?</em></p>
        <p>We cannot allow unregulated entry and then allow citizenship for all who wish economic opportunity. We do need and want immigration and new citizens but this must be regulated in a way that does not harm our economy or safety. 'Securing the Southern border and Amnesty' is not a solution. We must have a legal, regulated worker program that shrinks and grows as our unemployment rises and falls. We need immigrants for both agricultural jobs and high tech, intellectual jobs where we do not fill the jobs. We need vigorous 'town hall' discussions to reach the best balance.</p>
    
    <p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
        <p>We need an employer requirement that closes the loopholes in the legal worker checks like E-verify, probably by a 1099 requirement for subcontracted employees would be important. Continue border security and implement the 'Dream Act' for those who were brought in as children but have proven their loyalty and value to the U.S.</p>
    
    <hr />

<h3>Economy</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest issue facing the U.S. economy?</em></p>
        <p>Campaign finance and the exaggerated influence of wealthy multi-national corporations and individuals have, since the 1970s has led to dreadful income and asset inequality with a shrinking Middle Class. We must restore an honest economy, not a finance and gambling wall street economy. We need trade policies that protect U.S. jobs and wages. TPP is NAFTA on steroids. It is bad for the Middle Class. We need tax policy to eliminate loopholes so that the wealthy and the corporations pay their fair share. Raise the minimum wage! It will increase retail spending and invigorate the economy!</p>
    
    <p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
        <p>Raise the Capital Gain tax. Stop taxing work while excluding dynasty wealth in the tax policy. Implement the Buffett rule. Get rid of wasteful spending like tanks the military does not want. Bend the curve on health care costs. A public option would help this. Raise the minimum wage! It will improve the tax base</p>
    
    <p><em>What spending cuts or changes to the tax code are needed to reduce the national debt?</em></p>
        <p>See above, legislation to help.</p>
