        <p>Isa Infante is running for Tennessee Governor.</p>
        
        
            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Isa Infante has a Ph.D. in political science (B.A. and Ph.D. at the University of California; M.A. at Yale) and a law degree (Northeastern School of Law in Boston). Her professional experience has included teaching political science at the university level, an academic deanship, working for the U.S. Department of Education and also at the White House in Washington D.C. In addition, she has been a consultant to a wide range of legal, political, community, and international development organizations. Isa has been on the Board of Directors of organizations in cities where she resided, and has owned several small businesses and been elected to public service in New York, California and Connecticut, and previously ran for Mayor of Knoxville, TN. Currently, Isa Infante is the Coordinating Chair of the Green Party of Knox County, President of the Yale Club of Knoxville, and on the Board of Directors of My Place Performing Arts Center in Knoxville.</p>
        

        
            
            <h3>Issues</h3>

<p><em>Would you support or oppose an expansion of TennCare under the Affordable Care Act?</em></p>
    <p>Isa Infante supports the expansion of TennCare under the Affordable Care Act.  Every Tennessee citizen is deserving of affordable, accessible health care.  A healthier Tennessee will result in lower absenteeism at school and work, and in turn improve businesses and schools. Tennessee has already lost millions of dollars in federal money by not expanding TennCare.  Hospitals suffer a financial loss on a daily basis, health care workers are threatened with layoffs, and residents of rural communities are losing access to healthcare. The financial loss Tennessee has already suffered under the decision to not expand TennCare will be compounded by the costs that negligible health care imposes upon our state. Expanding TennCare is necessary for the health and education of Tennessee citizens, and for the Tennessee economy.</p>

<p><em>Do you support or oppose more restrictions on abortion in Tennessee?</em></p>
    <p>Isa Infante opposes more restrictions on abortion in Tennessee. Women and men have the right to make their own personal healthcare decisions.</p>

<p><em>What changes, if any, would you support for the state's Common Core education standards?</em></p>
    <p>The current Common Core education standards were developed to make children internationally competitive. Competition is not the goal of education. A new set of standards created with a "child-up" approach rather than a "top-down" approach needs to be created. The Common Core systems in place for school funding and teacher evaluations have resulted in teaching for the test, rather than teaching for the student.  Standards are needed as a measurement tool, but local communities, schools, and teachers, in partnership with state governing boards, should be developing the standards that best help a child to improve. The core of the Common Core standards needs to be thrown away.</p>

<p><em>Should the Hall income tax be reduced, repealed or kept in place?</em></p>
    <p>The Hall income tax, a personal tax on the interest of stocks, bonds and dividends, brings in over $200 million a year from some of Tennessee's wealthiest individuals. Money from the tax goes back into local communities. Nashville alone could stand to lose $10 million dollars if the Hall income tax is repealed. The repeal is supported by the Koch brothers, and if successful, could result in property taxes being raised. The Hall income tax should be kept in place so local communities can benefit from the originally-intended "trickle-down" effect of capitalism.</p>
