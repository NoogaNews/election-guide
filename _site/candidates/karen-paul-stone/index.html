            <h3>More info</h3>

<p><em>Why do you want to run for public office?</em></p>
    <p>Folks have asked me to run for office for many years because I am willing to listen to them and to speak up for them. Since my publishing business is in Walden, I now have the time to devote to the duties of Alderman, and feel it is time to fulfill obligations to my community in this way.</p>


<p><em>Please identify three issues that are important to you as a candidate.</em></p>
    <p>Walden citizens have told me these issues as important to them.<br><br>1. Roads, particularly the W Rd.<br>2. Taxes<br>3. Financing for the Pumpkin Patch, Bachman Community Center, WRES, Town Hall and Senator Bachman/McCoy park</p>


<p><em>If elected, how would you address those issues?</em></p>
    <p>1. Road paving, striping, reflectors, clearing, culverts, litter pick-up, etc. are already functions mandated by our Town charter, so we encourage reports of any particular problem so it can be solved promptly. The dangerous intersection at the top of the W Rd. and unwarranted closures of the W are two issues I would personally like to work on. Years ago a stream was diverted causing ice on the W and consequently causing the road to be closed too frequently. I think some cooperation with a water engineer and the sheriff's department could remedy the situation, and we can find more answers for safety at the top of the W. I pledge to take these on if elected.<br><br>2. Taxes are always of vital concern. My basic principle is to preserve Walden's quality of life in the most fiscally responsible way possible. I want to keep our taxes low in Walden, which leads to the next answer.<br><br>3. Walden is currently supporting three municipal buildings. All need good roofs, water and electric service, insurance coverage, etc. Walden also has some land in prime locations on Taft Highway. What if we were to sell the unused land and the building fronting Taft? Not only would we consolidate our assets into only two municipal buildings, but also we would generate tax revenue. We could turn non-income producing government property into income generating commercial property. Once our assets are consolidated, we would have fewer expenses and more revenue. Then we can better handle renovations and maintenance to the community centers and the playground, and perhaps have some left over for fire protection, while keeping taxes low. Please call me at 886-4568 or write karenstone@waldenhouse.com to discuss any of these points.</p>
