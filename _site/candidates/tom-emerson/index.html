            <h3>Health care</h3>
<p><em>What should be done to address the country's health care system?</em></p>
    <p>To begin with, Obamacare must be repealed. Health care should be made affordable and available to all citizens, regardless of their financial status. The best way to accomplish this is to allow the Church to become the main Health Care Provider.</p>

<p><em>If you oppose the Affordable Care Act or believe it should be modified, what are some of the alternatives you support?</em></p>
    <p>The definition of the Affordable Care Act is Obamacare. As stated above, the ""Affordable Care Act"" must be repealed.<br><br>I received a survey from the two sitting U.S. Senators, and my U.S. Congressman in reference to Obamacare. Once I began reading through this documented survey, it was very apparent that there are many hidden agendas, goals, items buried within Obamacare that have nothing whatsoever to do with Health Care.<br><br>Health Insurance is not affordable for all citizens. This must change and the Federal Government needs to bow out of thinking they know how to dictate to all citizens how all citizens should be forced to do this, or do that in order to have Health Care Coverage. The Federal Government needs to do their job and not become a Health Care Institute. There are Health Care Professionals who know best and need to have the freedom from the Federal Government to develop a affordable and available Health Care Plan.</p>



<h3>National security</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest threat to national security?</em></p>
    <p>The Federal Government. Let me explain. Congress and the Senate can be eager to send our United States Military personnel, service men and women overseas, into battle, into harms way to fight for the freedom we take for granted and enjoy daily. Our continued freedom is due solely and credited solely to the United States Military personnel.<br><br>When our U.S. Military personnel comes back home to America, most all with some level of PTSD, some without limbs, some in caskets; these very same U.S. Military personnel are ignored by their Federal Government in more than one way.<br><br>The United States Congress and Senate MUST support and SERVE our U.S. Military personnel and their families. This included all Veterans and Active Duty personnel, and their families.<br><br>Any one who has eyes and common sense can see that if their elected officials will not support them when they enlist in the U.S. Military, then why should they risk their lives for the elected officials, Congress and Senate.<br><br>When elected I want to address this issue by developing a law that states that every Congress man/woman and every Senator must travel with a branch of the U.S. Military for two to four weeks within the first year they are elected into their office. They must travel with the U.S. Military branch from the time that unit or command leaves the United States soil, be with them on tours while in harms way, and experience the very lifestyle that our service men and women experience for months and years. Then if that Congress man/woman and Senator comes back to their elected office, they will be empathetic and sympathetic to our U.S. Military personnel, including their families.<br><br>As I addressed in one city and county in Tennessee the Disabled American Veterans, I was appalled by the fact that so many have and have tried to commit suicide. I had the privilege to pray with one ex-solider who had tried to take his own life five times.<br><br>Now let me touch on the Veterans Administration. Need I say more? There is a retired soldier in the county I live in who has stated that he had a doctors appointment for a physical problem. Before that appointment arrived, he was contacted that the appointment had been rescheduled. This happened more than once. And this occurs with more than just one serviceman/woman. The VA needs serious restructuring and, so to speak, a shot in the arm.<br><br>We, America, but especially the Congress and Senate HAVE to do a much better job taking care of our U.S. Military personnel who we all depend on for the everyday freedom we take for granted and live.</p>

<p><em>Should the U.S. play a greater role in international affairs?</em></p>
    <p>The United States of America is in a catch 22. If the U.S. plays a lesser role in international affairs, then in reality we are putting ourselves in jeopardy. How are we putting ourselves in jeopardy? Because we owe too much money to other countries and are dependent upon the other countries we owe money to not to call our loan.<br><br>If we play a greater role in international affairs, we stand the chance of becoming too vulnerable and weak domestically.<br><br>Businesses have Procedures, Processes and policies in order to conduct their business the very beat and profitable way they can, equally not to take away from providing the best customer service.<br><br>The United States Federal Government, specifically the Congress and Senate have similar policies, procedures and processes.<br><br>In reality, there are always exceptions to those rules, in business and in government.<br><br>Each individual circumstance and situation must be addressed with how severe that situation is. If a international affair is severe and requires a greater role by the U.S. Congress and Senate, then the U.S. must provide a greater role until that severe situation has been resolved. At that time a lesser role can be enforced and adapted.</p>

<p><em>Do you support or oppose the Obama administration's military strategy against the Islamic State?</em></p>
    <p>I agree that the U.S. has to combat Islamic extremists such as ISIS/ISIL, Al Qaeda and such terrorist organizations. If America is put on the offensive, our military should attack full force; air, land and sea until the threat of terror has been eliminated.<br><br>If the U.S. Congress and Senate send our U.S. Military personnel to eliminate our enemy, in this case terrorists, then the Congress and Senate must back our military with everything they need to resolve this threat quickly.</p>


<h3>Energy</h3>
<p><em>How can the U.S. ensure greater energy independence?</em></p>
    <p>As long as there are safety procedures in place for oil drilling, I will be in favor of America producing our own oil and withdraw our dependence upon foreign nations for our necessary oil supply.<br><br>I understand in the United States of America lies a vast amount of crude oil whereby we could be very independent from foreign oil countries.<br><br>With today's technology, if the U.S. desired, safe drilling and production from crude oil to the various chemicals we need to run all machines today could and should be pursued until it becomes a reality.<br><br>More jobs, less fuel cost, more efficient use of fuels and a safer environment would and can be possible with the right officials being elected to office.</p>

<p><em>Is climate change a problem? If so, what policies do you support to curb it?</em></p>
    <p>If my history serves me correctly, climate has always been changing and will always continue to change. The only policies that could address this is, in my opinion, a more self contained and independent technology plan that is developed by United States scientists. And yes, the Federal Government would need to contribute monetarily to some extent, but in a realistic sence.</p>


<h3>Immigration</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest issue facing our current immigration system?</em></p>
    <p>America already has a process whereby any immigrant can follow to become a United States citizen. Follow the process and, ???Welcome to America???. Don???t follow the process, go home to your own country.<br><br>The Congress and Senate must keep their priorities in check. In order to enforce the Immigration Process, Congress and the Senate must support the Border Patrol, Homeland Security, Law Enforcement Agencies, Fire Fighters, First Responders and the United States Military.</p>

<p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
    <p>The Congress and Senate must keep their priorities in check. In order to enforce the Immigration Process, Congress and the Senate must support the Border Patrol, Homeland Security, Law Enforcement Agencies, Fire Fighters, First Responders and the United States Military.</p>


<h3>Economy</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest issue facing the U.S. economy?</em></p>
    <p>Review as many existing taxes as possible; restructure as many existing taxes as possible; and eliminate as many existing taxes as possible.<br><br>No New Taxes.<br><br>If Congress and the Senate want to vote themselves a raise, then that amount they voted a raise for themselves should be applied straight toward the National Debt.<br><br>Take away the special benefits the Congress and the Senate enjoy and apply that money toward the National Debt.</p>

<p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
    <p>Americans do not need any more taxes, nor more new taxes. When elected as the next United States Senator from Tennessee 2014, I will never vote for any new taxes.<br><br>What I will do is begin reviewing as many existing taxes as possible; restructure as many existing taxes as possible; and eliminate as many existing taxes as possible.</p>

<p><em>What spending cuts or changes to the tax code are needed to reduce the national debt?</em></p>
    <p>Taxes that exist today are not fair to all citizens. Because of the unrealistic spending by Congress and the Senate, the budget is not balanced and our deficit and debt is growing dramatically.<br><br>What about Education and Medical Research? All members of Congress and the Senate should be taxed a certain amount and that money distributed to Education and Medical Research.<br><br>I will repeal Common Core education.</p>
