            <h3>More info</h3>

<p><em>Why do you want to run for public office?</em></p>
    <p>I am running for Collegedale City Commission because I want to give back to the community that has shaped me and now I want to help shape the future of Collegedale.  I am humbled by serving others in my community and feel running for City Commission gives me the opportunity to help ensure Collegedale embraces the growth it will experience in the coming years while still maintaining the hometown values that make Collegedale a great place to live, work, and retire!</p>


<p><em>Please identify three issues that are important to you as a candidate.</em></p>
    <p>Three issues which are important to me are:<br>1. Government Transparency.<br>2. Intentional Planned Growth.<br>3. Protecting the integrity of Collegedale</p>


<p><em>If elected, how would you address those issues?</em></p>
    <p>1. Government Transparency. I want to work to make sure the citizens of Collegedale are informed with what their city government is doing. It is one thing for the city to get a message out to its citizens, however, it is imperative the city communicates that message! Once elected, I plan on proposing a Collegedale City App which would be available for download to smartphones and tablets to put information in citizens hands and put them in direct contact with the City Commission. Citizens would be able to receive immediate updates of Commission minutes and agendas. Push-notifications would be available to alert citizens of road closures, weather conditions, and events taking place in the city. This app gives every citizen the opportunity to be informed about what is going on in the city!<br><br>2. Intentional Planned Growth. Collegedale is expected to experience major growth over the next coming years. It is imperative that we as a city have a vision and a plan in place now, not later, which addresses this growth. If elected I will work to ensure the city is prepared for this growth now by being intentional about our growth. This includes expanding and improving our commercial design standards, working with land owners to make sure the development that comes to Collegedale is something which will complement the city, and working hard to bring businesses to Collegedale which improve the living standards of our residents.<br><br>3. Protecting the integrity of Collegedale. Collegedale is and will continue to be an amazing place to raise a family; founded on home town value the city respects and prides themselves on. Once elected, I will work to ensure Collegedale remains a great place to live, work, and retire! A place where its citizens are proud to call home!</p>
