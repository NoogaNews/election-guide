        <p>Lamar Alexander is running for U.S. Senate.</p>
        
        
            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Lamar Alexander represents Tennesseans with a conservative voice in the U.S. Senate. In its most recent evaluation, the National Rifle Association (NRA) gave Lamar an A rating. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) both gave his record a 100% for his pro-business votes in their most recent ratings. Similarly, the National Right to Life Committee also gave his voting record a 100% in its most recent rating for his efforts to protect life.<br><br>Lamar Alexander was born in Maryville, the son of a kindergarten teacher and an elementary school principal. He is a seventh-generation Tennessean.<br><br>He is the only Tennessean ever popularly elected both governor and U.S. Senator. He has been U.S. Education Secretary and University of Tennessee president. He chaired the National Governors Association and President Reagan's Commission on Americans Outdoors.<br><br>When elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, Alexander had spent more adult years in the private sector than in public life. In 1972 he co-founded a Nashville law firm. In 1987 he and his wife and three others, including Bob Keeshan, television???s Captain Kangaroo, founded Corporate Child Care, Inc. The company became publicly traded in 1997 (NASDAQ) and later merged with Bright Horizons, Inc., creating the world???s largest provider of worksite daycare.<br><br>Three times between 2007 and 2012, his colleagues elected Sen. Alexander Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference ??? the third-ranking Republican position in the United States Senate. He is the ranking Senate Republican overseeing education, labor and health, as well as energy appropriations.<br><br>In his campaign for governor, Alexander walked 1,000 miles across Tennessee in his now-famous red and black plaid shirt. Once elected, he helped Tennessee become the third largest auto producer, the state with the top-rated four-lane highway system and the first state to pay teachers more for teaching well. He started Tennessee???s Governor???s Schools for outstanding students. When he left the governor???s office, the state had a Triple AAA bond rating, fewer employees and no long-term highway debt.<br><br>He is a classical and country pianist and the author of seven books, including Six Months Off, the story of his family???s life in Australia after he was governor.<br><br>Lamar Alexander and Honey Buhler were married in 1969. They have four children and six grandchildren. He is a Presbyterian elder.<br><br>Lamar Alexander has a conservative voting record. In their most recent ratings, Lamar received an A rating from the NRA, 100 percent from the U.S. Chamber, 100 percent from the NFIB and 100 percent from National Right to Life.</p>
        

        
            <h3>Health care</h3>
<p><em>What should be done to address the country's health care system?</em></p>
    <p>The new health care law is adding costs that destroy jobs and increase premiums. We need to repair the damage of Obamacare and prevent further damage.</p>

<p><em>If you oppose the Affordable Care Act or believe it should be modified, what are some of the alternatives you support?</em></p>
    <p>To repair the damage Obamacare has done, we should replace it with step-by-step reforms that increase freedom and choice and reduce the cost of health insurance. For example, we should allow people to purchase insurance across state lines and allow small businesses to pool together so they can buy insurance for their employees. Step-by-step reforms like these will not only lower health insurance costs. They will make it easier for Americans to find a good job since job creators will find it less expensive to create new jobs.</p>



<h3>National security</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest threat to national security?</em></p>
    <p>Both the Islamic State and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa are grave threats to our national security.</p>

<p><em>Should the U.S. play a greater role in international affairs?</em></p>
    <p>The United States needs to project strength on the international stage while weighing carefully the costs of getting involved in any more prolonged conflicts in the Middle East or elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>Do you support or oppose the Obama administration's military strategy against the Islamic State?</em></p>
    <p>What we need from President Obama is a clear military plan ??? instead of a political plan ??? for destroying the Islamic State and stopping its 4th-century brand of barbarism. The president should consult with military leaders and present a plan to Congress to consider.</p>


<h3>Energy</h3>
<p><em>How can the U.S. ensure greater energy independence?</em></p>
    <p>I have suggested four grand principles to help us chart a competitive energy future for our country. Those principles are 1) cheaper, not more expensive, energy; 2) clean, not just renewable, energy; 3) research and development, not government mandates; 4) free market, not government picking "winners and losers."</p>

<p><em>Is climate change a problem? If so, what policies do you support to curb it?</em></p>
    <p>The best thing we can do to protect our environment is focus on the principles I???ve stated above while working to double government-sponsored energy research and allowing our free enterprise system to create an abundance of clean, cheap, reliable energy.</p>


<h3>Immigration</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest issue facing our current immigration system?</em></p>
    <p>Our country???s border security is a mess.</p>

<p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
    <p>First, we need to secure the border. Then we need to end the perpetual amnesty for the more than 11 million people who are already here and treat them as we would those who break the law ??? find them and fine them. I voted in 2013 to secure the border and end amnesty.</p>


<h3>Economy</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest issue facing the U.S. economy?</em></p>
    <p>Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. We need to fix the federal government???s nearly $18 trillion debt, and that???s why Senator Corker and I have proposed legislation that would reduce the growth of out-of-control entitlement spending by nearly $1 trillion.</p>

<p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
    <p>The main reason it is so hard for our free enterprise system to create jobs is that the federal government has imposed so many costs and regulations on job creators ??? from Obamacare to new taxes. We need to liberate our free enterprise system from many of the Obama administration???s rules and regulations.</p>

<p><em>What spending cuts or changes to the tax code are needed to reduce the national debt?</em></p>
    <p>Our greatest challenge is raising family incomes. It is too hard to find a job today because it has become too hard to create new jobs.</p>
