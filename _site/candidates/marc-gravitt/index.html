            <h3>Issues</h3>

<p><em>Would you support or oppose an expansion of TennCare under the Affordable Care Act?</em></p>
    <p>Tennessee must balance its budget. If TennCare is expanded, other areas of spending, such as education, will suffer. I will work with our Governor to address the feasibility of a Tennessee Plan that is a defined contribution rather than a defined beneift.</p>

<p><em>Do you support or oppose more restrictions on abortion in Tennessee?</em></p>
    <p>Tennesseans have the opportunity to vote, as do I, to return the issue of abortion to the General Assembly rather than an unelected body, the judiciary.</p>

<p><em>What changes, if any, would you support for the state's Common Core education standards?</em></p>
    <p>There must be educational standards that show consistent results that benefit our children. Decisions should ideally be made by our local school board, teachers and parents. Standards should exist to make sure our children receive a quality education that competes in a workforce for high-paying jobs. Concerns about Common Core seem to point to the excessive testing and some of the curriculum. There is a lot of room for improvement.</p>

<p><em>Should the Hall income tax be reduced, repealed or kept in place?</em></p>
    <p>The Hall Income tax penalizes those who save and invest. The elimination of this tax must be gradual and in a manner that phases out the funding to municipalities that will likely be forced to increase property taxes. Collegedale and East Ridge are two communities in District 30 that receive taxes collected by the Hall Tax. I know that these communities do not want to see an increase in their property taxes as an unintended consequence.</p>
