            <h3>More info</h3>

<p><em>Why do you want to run for public office?</em></p>
    <p>As an East Ridge City Councilman, Robert Stahl will work to grow East Ridge's economy through smart business planning and development by using the knowledge he has gained from earning a business degree as well as the professional skills he has developed over the past 38 years in banking. Furthermore, Stahl is running for public office because he is at a point in his life where he wants to give back to the community that has given so much to him throughout his life.</p>


<p><em>Please identify three issues that are important to you as a candidate.</em></p>
    <p>The top three issues of importance to Robert Stahl are 1) Economic Development; 2) Budget Enhancement; and, 3) Community Involvement.</p>


<p><em>If elected, how would you address those issues?</em></p>
    <p>1. As your City Councilman, Stahl will commit himself to ensuring that the budgetary process focuses on providing the police department, fire and rescue as well as emergency personnel of East Ridge with the resources and tools it needs to keep East Ridge safe and secure.<br><br>2. As your City Councilman, Stahl will scrutinize the use of East Ridge's budgetary dollars to attempt to carve out funds that can be reinvested in current businesses, parks and various locations around East Ridge in an effort to accentuate the beauty of our town.<br><br>3. As your City Councilman, Stahl will push for a major effort to take better advantage of marketing opportunities at the I-24 and I-75 intersection. Specifically, Stahl will encourage a conversation and debate among the elected officials about the wonderful geographical position East Ridge has for travelers and how we can better utilize marketing funds.<br><br>4. As your City Councilman, Stahl will connect East Ridge with a network of business developers and proven business leaders to help initiate new restaurants, shops and lodging in an effort to attract business and stimulate East Ridge's economy with locals as well as those traveling through East Ridge from other locations.<br><br>5. As your City Councilman, Stahl will encourage the development of a forum that brings together citizens of East Ridge in a setting where everyone can share past experiences - whether successful or not - to help stimulate new ideas. Certainly, there is a wealth of knowledge in East Ridge that is not being tapped because so many people think nobody is interested in what they have to say. It's time for that to change.</p>
