            <h3>Health care</h3>
    <p><em>What should be done to address the country's health care system?</em></p>
        <p>Despite the increasing cost, our current health care system has many positive attributes. We need to build upon these, but there are changes that can be made to not only lower costs but to also provide patients with the care that they need, want, and deserve. A government run health insurance program, however, is not the answer. It would take control away from the doctors, threaten employer-sponsored health insurance, and limit individual choices. Government run health insurance simply does not work.</p>
    
    <p><em>If you oppose the Affordable Care Act or believe it should be modified, what are some of the alternatives you support?</em></p>
        <p>I believe that America's health care system is worth saving. I believe that its problems can be resolved in such a way that no one loses their current health insurance or the right to choose their own doctor. Our solutions, however, must be made in a fiscally responsible manner so that affordable health care can be expanded to include both early detection and prevention, yet not limit patient choice and patient-doctor control.<br><br>Malpractice law, as an example, must be reformed to eliminate both excessive medical liability costs and frivolous lawsuits. Additionally, we must ensure that reimbursement to providers is at levels that will allow them to provide continued care to their patients.</p>

<h3>National security</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest threat to national security?</em></p>
        <p>Nuclear proliferation and cyber attacks both pose significant threats to the security of our nation. Cyber attacks, while a fairly new threat, should not be underestimated. The unique challenges posed by cyber attacks require foresight, innovation, and strong intelligence from our agencies. Other nations are already working tirelessly to improve their defense against cyber attacks &mdash; we cannot afford to be a step behind.</p>
    
    <p><em>Should the U.S. play a greater role in international affairs?</em></p>
        <p>The U.S. must increase its presence on the international stage, assuming more leadership in directing policy, as well as partnering with our friends across the globe in defending democracy, supporting economic growth, and aiding in world health initiatives.</p>
    
    <p><em>Do you support or oppose the Obama administration's military strategy against the Islamic State?</em></p>
        <p>I have supported it in the past. However, it is a situation that needs to be monitored very closely. The administration must have a prudent and feasible plan that will give us lasting peace in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>
    <p><em>How can the U.S. ensure greater energy independence?</em></p>
        <p>It is imperative to our national security that the United States becomes energy independent. In order to do so, comprehensive energy legislation is needed, with particular attention given to environmentally safe energy exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR) and the Outer Continental Shelf.<br><br>Nuclear power is a safe, effective, and environmentally friendly way to produce energy for our country. Greater reliance on nuclear power will result in a reduction of imported oil from nations friendly to terrorists. Nuclear power creates jobs, provides large amounts of energy at a time when energy costs are so high, and strengthens our national security and economic stability. A critical provider of American nuclear power is our own Anderson County, specifically Oak Ridge.</p>
    
    <p><em>Is climate change a problem? If so, what policies do you support to curb it?</em></p>
        <p>It is critical that we pursue more environmentally-friendly methods of producing gas and oil. We must also further the development of clean coal power and the expansion of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar power. Simply put, we can employ common sense and innovation to meet our current and future energy needs.</p>

<h3>Immigration</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest issue facing our current immigration system?</em></p>
        <p>America's current immigration policies are not working. Change is needed. I am convinced that our country's border security is paramount to our nation's security. The security of America's southern border can be improved by increasing the number of border enforcement agents, completing and enhancing the current fence, and implementing the use of new technology.</p>
    
    <p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
        <p>An estimated 15 to 20 million illegal immigrants currently reside in the United States. I do not support rewarding these illegal immigrants with amnesty. In 1986, when legislation was passed granting general amnesty, the illegal immigrant population quadrupled. Security along the border can be improved by increasing border agents, completing and enhancing the fence, and equipping border agents with the necessary technology.</p>

<h3>Economy</h3>
    <p><em>What is the biggest issue facing the U.S. economy?</em></p>
        <p>The biggest problem facing our economy is Washington's excessive spending. The national debt must be reined in. The government's massive spending to stem the tide of rising unemployment has proven to be counterproductive. Rather, the adoption of policies that promote business investment, lower taxes and reduce the regulatory burdens on business will turn our economy around and create sustainable jobs.</p>
    
    <p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
        <p>I practiced law in the Tennessee Valley for 24 years, working directly with a host of small businesses. I understand firsthand that small businesses are responsible for creating 80% of all the new jobs in our country during the last 20 years. In order for our economy to rebound during this current economic crisis, we need strong job growth, which I believe will correspond directly with small business growth. We do not need more government intervention. The government's excessive spending must be curbed, coupled with policies that promote investment into American businesses which are the key to rejuvenating our economy and jump starting job growth.</p>
    
    <p><em>What spending cuts or changes to the tax code are needed to reduce the national debt?</em></p>
        <p>All government spending should be subject to review and possible spending cuts. Eliminating waste from our federal government should be a key component to any cost-saving strategy.</p>
