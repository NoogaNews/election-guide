            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in Hamilton County. Grew up in Ooltewah and have lived in Lakesite, TN for 23+ years. I earned a B.S. in business with a major in accounting and a Masters of Accountancy (MACC) both from the UT system. I have over 25 years experience in business, accounting, and finance in areas of nonprofit and with the majority spent in the manufacturing segment. I have proudly served as Lakesite Commissioner of Budget and finance and Economic Development for the past four years as well as participating on the board of directors for both the Dallas Bay Volunteer Fire Department (DBVFD) and the North Hamilton County council of the Chamber of Commerce. I have enjoyed giving back to my community and working for my neighbors and fellow citizens of this wonderful city.</p>
        

        
            
            
            <h3>More info</h3>

<p><em>Why do you want to run for public office?</em></p>
    <p>I want to continue to serve my friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens as their voice in the running of their community as they need someone who not only cares but is personally invested along with them in all the things this city is responsible for that affects each of our daily lives while giving them the surety that our best interests are being taken care of in the best, most effective and efficient manner so they can go about their busy daily lives with the knowledge that their concerns and best interests are being taken care of and hopefully they can be inspired to get involved in anyway that they can manage while maintaining a balance with their personal lives.</p>


<p><em>Please identify three issues that are important to you as a candidate.</em></p>
    <p>There are many issues that are important to me not only as a candidate but as a citizen of this city as well.  Three of them are as follows.<br><br>1. Working to maintain a positive and healthy economic balance that allows needed convinces and progressive businesses to come into our city and thrive to benefit not only our citizens but also the businesses and owners so that we have a good foundation to generate the correct growth that brings value and real convenience for our citizens as well as providing enough business taxes to offset and keep the property tax rates at our current low all while keeping the small hometown feel that attracted us all to move here in the first place.  Also to be close to a big city and utilize those attributes while maintaining the positive safe, beautiful, and peaceful family friendly environment.<br><br>2. Over site of our financial fiduciary responsibilities to ensure that we are truly getting the biggest and best bang for all our bucks while making sure that our city government spends those funds conservatively and efficiently with upmost jurisprudence to benefit the community and citizens as a whole.<br><br>3. Keep the citizens informed and in the loop on all the issues that come up for discussion and action by the city.  As an elected official, I am here to be your voice on any matter that comes before the city.</p>


<p><em>If elected, how would you address those issues?</em></p>
    <p>If re-elected, my plan to address these and all issues that come before the commission is to deal with each issue on a case by case situation by taking the suggestions, comments, ideas, and advice that I receive from the community as a whole and all citizens who reach out to me to voice their concerns, opinions, and ideas as I am merely their elected voice. I want each of my community's citizens to know that I am here and available to speak with them and take their concerns before the commission.<br><br>1. I will continue to work with my contacts, while establishing more, to keep moving forward to not only promote the city and all its remarkable selling attributes for businesses but to bring them in to benefit all of our community.<br><br>2. Start a more in depth look into current city spending matters to make sure that we are being frugal and efficient in all of our financial aspects and that we continue to do so as we move forward.<br><br>3. Open up more dialogue with the citizens. Continue to work on getting more citizen involvement as that is the key to a healthy, thriving small town city. It is very important to get all citizens involved together to help shape our city for the benefit of all our friends, family, and neighbors. It is our responsibility to look out for and take care of each other. This is my way of giving back because I truly care very deeply about my city, citizens, neighbors, friends, and family, my home.</p>
