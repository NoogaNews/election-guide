            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>My given name is Edmund Louis Gauthier and as far as I know, I am of French descent on my father???s side and German on my mothers (therefore I don't know whether to surrender or fight :). I am divorced with no children. I???m 48 years old and was born in Texas. When I was three, my family moved to the bay area of California because of my father???s work (he was a magnificent mechanic). When I was twelve, we moved to a small farming community in south central Illinois where my mother is originally from. When I graduated high school, I immediately joined the U.S. Army and after my service, I attended college using my GI Bill and graduated in 1992 from Southern Illinois University with a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I start working in construction management for a company out of Chicago, and in 1993 I volunteered for a project they had at a small coal fired power plant in Cumberland City, Tennessee. When the project was complete I chose not to go back to Chicago and I have called Dover, Tennessee home ever since. I have been working federal construction, primarily on Ft. Campbell, since 1994.</p>
        

        
            <h3>Health care</h3>
<p><em>What should be done to address the country's health care system?</em></p>
    <p>Do we need a national health care program to care for all citizens of this country? ABSOLUTELY! Do we need the one that has been jambed down our throats and that was orchestrated by the insurance industry, pharmacutical business, and for-profit health care conglomerants? NO! The AHCA is just another example of our government being high-jacked for the profit of private business at the expense of the average American citizen. You Don't believe me?!?! Then why has Wal-Mart decided to get into the health insurance business?? Because thanks to our bought and paid for elected officials, there's alot of money to be made now.</p>

<p><em>If you oppose the Affordable Care Act or believe it should be modified, what are some of the alternatives you support?</em></p>
    <p>First thing is first......instead of the health care and insurance industry writing the rules for a health care system funded by our tax dollars WE will write the rules and guidelines for a national health care system and TELL them what they will cover and what they will be paid or THEY will be fined for not participating, rather than the way it is now that the folks who can afford this crappy insurance least are fined.</p>



<h3>National security</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest threat to national security?</em></p>
    <p>Well, I know I'm going to catch some flak for this.....but the biggest threat to this country's national security is our government itself. We have a government that is paid by foriegn interests to send America's finest all over the world to be policemen. Then our government feed's the American public lie's and incomplete truths to justify it. Folks....do not confuse the "security" of the government with the "security" of the citizens......they are not the same and the government really has no interest in the latter unless there is a dollar to be made in it.</p>

<p><em>Should the U.S. play a greater role in international affairs?</em></p>
    <p>Unless there is a DIRECT threat to America or American citizens, the United States should mind it's own business. But people argue with me on this and say....."but Ed, we've had American citizens beheaded by these Islamic animals." My response is this.....if you go to the U.S. State Department website, it clearly lists the dangerous places that Americans should avoid. I feel for these people and their family's, but they went to an area that they KNEW was dangerous!! Look, how many American tourist and Missionaries have been taken hostage, murdered, or flat out disappeared in South American countries by drug cartels and rebels or both!?!? Using this logic, we should invade Mexico, Columbia, Nicaragua, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p><em>Do you support or oppose the Obama administration's military strategy against the Islamic State?</em></p>
    <p>That is an intentionally misleading question. Look, I am no fan of the Obama administration, but the American "Middle-Eastern" (not Islamic because this is NOT a war on a particular religion, and this is NOT the crusades) policy hasn't changed since the 12th of September 2001. And you know what.....it's only made matters WORSE..... plus it's cost six times the American lives than were lost on 9/11, not to mention the millions of civilian casualties and has further endured us in the hearts of the middle eastern population. So to answer your question, I do NOT support the Bush/Obama middle-eastern policy.</p>


<h3>Energy</h3>
<p><em>How can the U.S. ensure greater energy independence?</em></p>
    <p>Right now there is no money in developing and marketing alternative energys, and that's just how the oil and automotive industry/lobbies want to keep it........at least until the oil money runs out or we find a way to make solar, methane, geo-thermal, nuclear fision, nuclear fusion (when it happens), etc., etc., profitable. I do know one thing for sure, that eliminating the coal industry in this country is a really bad idea and will do irreparable damage to the economy....although the oil folks are loving it.....drive that price of oil up.</p>

<p><em>Is climate change a problem? If so, what policies do you support to curb it?</em></p>
    <p>This summer when we had that cool spell in July, I would listen to folks laugh and say...."yeah.....look at this global warming. Coolest July on record." Well yes it is.....in our little tiny part of the WORLD. But if folks did some real research, they would find that what the scientist are primarily refering too is the ocean currents, which intern affect the overall GLOBAL weather patterns. But this isn't a science class, the point is this, our weather IS changing....the fluxuations are getting larger. Remember the weather when we were kids? I remember as a young teen in south central Illionois, we would get snow every year. Now, it's nothing one season and a crap load the next. Our weather patterns are changing. Now, has it been induced by man's pollution, or is it the natural cycle of things?  Or maybe a little of both. I do know one thing, they have figured out how to attached "money" to this eco phenom.....carbon credits!! The minute money got attached to this environmental issue, I new it was going to get taken to the extreme, and I think that is exactly what is happening. Do we need to curb or impact on our world....probably, yes. Do we do it at the exchagerated expense of progress or human prosperity......no. I got a feeling ole mother earth is pretty resilient and she's going to do what she wants to do, humans be or not.</p>


<h3>Immigration</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest issue facing our current immigration system?</em></p>
    <p>I don't understand all the hoopla over immigration and I certainly don't understand the sudden, compelling need our government has for ""blanket amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. In construction, I work with immigrants all the time. It is managements job to ensure they are all legal to work, especially on a federal installation. Most of the gentleman that are here on work visas have no desire to become American citizens. They simply are here to work and send the money home to where ever that is, and that is fine. But the point is, they are here working legally. It didn't require that much effort on their part to obtain the necessary paperwork. The few that wish to become American citizens, have applied for citizenship, paid the six hundred and something dollars, take the night courses (on top of working a full week), and are learning ENGLISH. I have all the respect in the world for these men, the ones that are here just to work and the ones that want to be Americans. So, I don't see a immigration system that needs fixing, and I certainly don't see the need for wholesale amnesty......what I see is an immigration system that just needs enforcing!</p>

<p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
    <p>I support enforcing the policies we have, deporting the illlegals that are here, regarless of how long they have been here, their age, or the "anchor-babies" that they think will keep them safe. Becoming an American citizen isn't all that difficult nor expensive.</p>


<h3>Economy</h3>
<p><em>What is the biggest issue facing the U.S. economy?</em></p>
    <p>No one will ever convince that the federal government doesn't take in enough cash to maintain all the necessary services (given the amount of taxes we pay on EVERYTHING). I truly believe that if WE had any idea of the true scope of wasteful spending and over spending, it would make us physically ill. Besides implementing a flat tax system, what I would like to do is have an independent audit performed on the government books. NOT the GAO, not a B.S. congressional panel or senate committee.....an honest to goodness independent accounting agency from "no-wheres-ville, North Dakota" with NO political ties or interests to create a good ole fashion spread-sheet of the black and red numbers of the cash coming in and the cash going out. Every agency, every department, every red cent would be accounted for. And once that is complete and findings are presented to the American tax payer, let the slashing begin!! Now, would the powers that be EVER let this happen? Probably not......unless.... WE THE PEOPLE say we do!</p>

<p><em>What policies or legislation do you support to address that issue?</em></p>
    <p>Institute a flat tax system, reduce the size of governemnt (thus reducing operating cost), and put the dollar back on a gold/silver system.</p>

<p><em>What spending cuts or changes to the tax code are needed to reduce the national debt?</em></p>
    <p>There are MANY issues, but the biggest in my opinion is the amount of money taken from the working man's pay check and the amount of money NOT taken from those who get the most out of our government......and I'm not talking about the welfare cases, I'm talking about the mega-companies that keep the profits made off the backs of the American population but don't pay their share of taxes which in turn puts undue burden on an already over-taxed middle class. We MUST put into place a flat tax system that everybody pays their fair share (hey.....the supreme court said that corporations are people too :), relieve the stress on small businesses and the middle class and then I think we would start to see an improvement in the overall economy.</p>
