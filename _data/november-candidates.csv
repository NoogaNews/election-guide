In its most recent evaluation, the National Rifle Association (NRA) gave Lamar an A rating. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) both gave his record a 100% for his pro-business votes in their most recent ratings. Similarly, the National Right to Life Committee also gave his voting record a 100% in its most recent rating for his efforts to protect life.</p><p>Lamar Alexander was born in Maryville, the son of a kindergarten teacher and an elementary school principal. He is a seventh-generation Tennessean.</p><p>He is the only Tennessean ever popularly elected both governor and U.S. Senator. He has been U.S. Education Secretary and University of Tennessee president. He chaired the National Governors Association and President Reagan's Commission on Americans Outdoors.</p><p>When elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, Alexander had spent more adult years in the private sector than in public life. In 1972 he co-founded a Nashville law firm. In 1987 he and his wife and three others, including Bob Keeshan, television’s Captain Kangaroo, founded Corporate Child Care, Inc. The company became publicly traded in 1997 (NASDAQ) and later merged with Bright Horizons, Inc., creating the world’s largest provider of worksite daycare.</p><p>Three times between 2007 and 2012, his colleagues elected Sen. Alexander Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference — the third-ranking Republican position in the United States Senate. He is the ranking Senate Republican overseeing education, labor and health, as well as energy appropriations.</p><p>In his campaign for governor, Alexander walked 1,000 miles across Tennessee in his now-famous red and black plaid shirt. Once elected, he helped Tennessee become the third largest auto producer, the state with the top-rated four-lane highway system and the first state to pay teachers more for teaching well. He started Tennessee’s Governor’s Schools for outstanding students. When he left the governor’s office, the state had a Triple AAA bond rating, fewer employees and no long-term highway debt.</p><p>He is a classical and country pianist and the author of seven books, including Six Months Off, the story of his family’s life in Australia after he was governor.</p><p>Lamar Alexander and Honey Buhler were married in 1969. They have four children and six grandchildren. He is a Presbyterian elder.</p><p>Lamar Alexander has a conservative voting record. In their most recent ratings, Lamar received an A rating from the NRA, 100 percent from the U.S. Chamber, 100 percent from the NFIB and 100 percent from National Right to Life.</p>",2,"us-senate","U.S. Senate","lamar-alexander.jpg","false","federal",,,,,,,,,,,,

I am divorced with no children. I’m 48 years old and was born in Texas. When I was three, my family moved to the bay area of California because of my father’s work (he was a magnificent mechanic). When I was twelve, we moved to a small farming community in south central Illinois where my mother is originally from. When I graduated high school, I immediately joined the U.S. Army and after my service, I attended college using my GI Bill and graduated in 1992 from Southern Illinois University with a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I start working in construction management for a company out of Chicago, and in 1993 I volunteered for a project they had at a small coal fired power plant in Cumberland City, Tennessee. When the project was complete I chose not to go back to Chicago and I have called Dover, Tennessee home ever since. I have been working federal construction, primarily on Ft. Campbell, since 1994.",2,"us-senate","U.S. Senate","edmund-gauthier.jpg","false","federal",,,,,,,,,,,,
