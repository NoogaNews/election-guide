bio: I am a 39 year old blue collar worker. My wife Wendy and I have been married for 21 years and we have 6 living children. I work as an electrician by trade and we home school our children. We balance our budget on one middle income and live within our means. We serve in our church and I have served in the ministry as an evangelist, youth pastor, men's pastor, and pastor.<br><br>I believe that the Christian church has lost it's way and is bringing about the chastisement of the Lord upon this country which by His hand and direction was founded. Our only solution is to practice 2 Chronicles 7:14. Judgement must begin at the house of God and therefore the church must stop blaming the unbelievers.<br><br>I will serve as US Senator protecting the liberties of both the unbeliever and the believer. Government is no place for dictating beliefs or morality. Our rights are God given and the rights of the unbeliever must be protected as well. I will serve and not rule.
