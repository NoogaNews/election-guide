q1: Simply put, I want to keep the good things about our town good and help make things better that can be better.<br><br>I have served on the town council and planning commission for eight years and have learned how important it is to make decisions with the whole town in mind. It is essential to look at the big picture and consider how a decision might impact the community as a whole.<br><br>My children are off at school now, and Town Council is my work. I love to roll up my sleeves and work with others to look for solutions to a problem. If re-elected I would continue to work hard to keep the quality of life that we enjoy.
q2: 1. How much/how fast can we grow?<br>2. Waste treatment<br>3. Speeding in our neighborhoods
q3: Growth<br><br>The town can employ tools to slow and limit growth, but we have no control of what is going on in the county. I would suggest we gather together the citizens and leaders of the town, Walden and the unincorporated part of Hamilton County along with some urban planning experts to ensure that our facilities and infrastructure can keep up with the pace of growth.<br><br>Waste Treatment<br><br>We are under a sewer moratorium. New neighborhoods are being planned on septic systems. We need to ensure that any new application of septic systems is conducted observing all the latest TDEC requirements. We have done preliminary studies on expanding the sewer system and have identified the areas of priority, which have failing septic systems that are polluting our streams. We need to begin discussions of funding options for expanding sewer and be ready to begin that work the WWTA once the moratorium has been lifted. <br><br>Speeding in neighborhoods<br><br>We have been working to develop solutions that will not cause unintended consequences -- such as speed bumps that are obtrusive enough to slow traffic but that will not cause bicycle accidents or impede certain vehicles. I think it would be beneficial to have public meetings with the neighbors of Hidden Brook and other areas where speeding is rampant to discuss possible options.
