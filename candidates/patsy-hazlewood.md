q1: Supporting the simple "expansion of TennCare" is not workable due to a recurring expense being expanded with non-recurring dollars.  I do support the Governor's efforts in working with the General Assembly, doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies to develop a "Tennessee Plan" that provides insurance coverage for the working poor that does not jeopardize other budget areas, like education. Tennessee has to balanced its budget while the Federal government simply prints money.
q2: I support Amendment One and the ability for voters to have a voice on the issue. I also support that the decision-making and governance of such a personal issue to be within the branch of government of the people and not the judiciary.
q3: Local school districts must continue to be empowered to make decisions impacting their students, teachers and families, i.e. curriculum, textbooks, testing, etc..  At the same time, we must require our students to master the knowlege an skills rhat will allow them to compete in a global economy, be prepared for higher education without remediation, and ultimately obtain a high-paying job. I will support modifications that accomplish these results.
q4: The Hall Income tax should be phased out gradually to allow muncipal and county governments that rely on that revenue to plan for that fuding's replacement or to adjust their budgets.
