bio: My given name is Edmund Louis Gauthier and as far as I know, I am of French descent on my father’s side and German on my mothers (therefore I don't know whether to surrender or fight :). I am divorced with no children. I’m 48 years old and was born in Texas. When I was three, my family moved to the bay area of California because of my father’s work (he was a magnificent mechanic). When I was twelve, we moved to a small farming community in south central Illinois where my mother is originally from. When I graduated high school, I immediately joined the U.S. Army and after my service, I attended college using my GI Bill and graduated in 1992 from Southern Illinois University with a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I start working in construction management for a company out of Chicago, and in 1993 I volunteered for a project they had at a small coal fired power plant in Cumberland City, Tennessee. When the project was complete I chose not to go back to Chicago and I have called Dover, Tennessee home ever since. I have been working federal construction, primarily on Ft. Campbell, since 1994.
