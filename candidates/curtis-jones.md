bio: I was born at Erlanger 11/21/1954 and lived in Hixson growing up. I bought my first home in Lakesite in 1980, where I live now. I was a carpenter for 12 years (local union 74) before becoming an instrument mechanic for TVA with training from Chattanooga State. I just recently retired from TVA as a senior instrument mechanic.

q1: A few months ago, the commission had voted 3 to 2 for installing sewers in Lakesite and this proposal got more people to the next meeting than ever before. I went to this meeting and several since then. I felt like the ones who voted to put the sewers in were not in touch with the residents of Lakesite. I am hoping to stop this click by replacing one of the 3 who voted for the sewer installation.
q2: Integrity is first.<br>Staying in touch with the residents and their issues.<br>What are we spending our tax dollars on.
q3: Integrity is easy...don't lie, it's easy to remember the truth.<br><br>I will contact residents and get their email address(if they have them) and send them updates of what is going on.<br><br>I have heard a few things from going to the meetings, but will do research and talk with the other council members along with residents to make decisions at council meetings, if elected.
