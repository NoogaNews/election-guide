q1: I was asked by several individuals who felt our city needed to move in a new direction. My opponent opposes the new zoning ordinances, which are vital to the future of Red Bank. I have lived in Red Bank since 1977 and have watched our city decline because of past leadership who were happy with the status quo.
q2: To attract young professional residents to our City. In order for a City to survive it must attract young families, failure to do so will result in the death of our city, look at Detroit as an example. Pass the new zoning ordinances, which will make it possible for new single family affordable housing, the old lot size restrictions make it impossible for new family housing currently. Public safety, my opponent recently voted against giving our police officers electronic pads for use in their squad cars, the use of this technology would actually save the city money by reducing time spent on paperwork, it would also aid in the identification of potential lawbreakers by the use of outstanding warrant database search. When questioned by a citizen, why she voted against this, she refused to answer.
q3: I will vote to pass the new zoning laws, I will vote to issue the electronic pads to our police officers, I will listen to the citizens of Red Bank and answer their questions on every issue. I will always remember that I work for the citizens of Red Bank.
