bio: I am a fifth-generation East Ridge citizen and have been a lifelong resident. I graduated from East Ridge High School in 1994, and subsequently earned a B.A. in History from UTC and a Master of Public Administration degree from Valdosta State. My history of service to the community includes three different terms on the East Ridge Chamber of Commerce Board, a stint as City Councilman (2008-2010), and as Mayor (2010-2014). I am married and have four children, and am a member of Spring Creek Road Baptist Church.

q1: I am running for re-election as Mayor in order to continue the very positive momentum we currently enjoy as a community, which ultimately will make the city a stronger and more desirable place to live, work, and play. We continually attempt to improve quality of life for residents while keeping taxes as low as possible. And with the announcement of the future Bass Pro Shops store, we have been able to activate our "Border Region" district enabling development and redevelopment all along Ringgold Road. In fact, there is an unprecedented amount of economic development activity taking place at this time.
q2: The three issues that are most important to me as a candidate include public safety, economic development, and fiscal responsibility.
q3: We will continue to provide our public safety officials with the best possible training and equipment so that we ensure overall safety and security of our community. We already have done a great deal in regard to economic development, but we must continue to take advantage of the extraordinary development interest being shown toward East Ridge. This is a great opportunity to beautify Ringgold Road and expand the retail options that can be enjoyed within our city. Lastly, we are in a very solid financial position, with a AA rating from Moody's, a healthy rainy day fund, and three consecutive years of budget surpluses. We will continue to implement strong, conservative economic policies in order to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.
