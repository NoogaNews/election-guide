bio: I have been living in Red Bank for three and a half years and although I do not have a deep history in this city, together WE have a vast future. Living just outside Midvale Park, it is truly a treat to be apart of this city. I am a member of the Hamilton County Pachyderm Club and the Hamilton County Young Republicans.

q1: While considering the decision to run back in late February it became apparent to me that Red Bank was in need of a makeover. That is when i decided to run for Commissioner of District 3. I feel that it is the best service to give to the city that I now live in to represent the citizens and my community while bringing new and youthful ideas. Red Bank is in a very unique situation due its low taxes and its proximity to the North Shore area making it the next destination to look when searching for a new home, with the right commission sitting on the board, a proactive commission, there are only great things to come for the City.
q2: The three most important issues to me as the District 3 candidate are fairly simple. The first is the city has so much empty space, space that could be used to create and foster up and coming business. The second is that we must build the tax base for the City. Don't worry, this does not mean raising taxes! The third, to change the perception of this great city to attract more families, buyers, and business. Every decision that is made from the board is important, every single one.
q3: To begin, I have stated in public on several different occasions that I would like to start an incubator program within the city, bringing home occupations  to store fronts and creating a home for entrepreneurs in the surrounding area. As a bored member I will work tirelessly to strike a deal with the property owners of these empty space to allow the very low cost of using this space, charging entrepreneurs no more that one hundred and fifty dollars a month and the cost of utilities. As a board we must not halt business but find it in ourselves to do what we can to help it thrive. I believe that after a deal is struck, we will have no problem filling these spaces giving residents and outsiders coming in new places to shop, spend money and help support local business. Did I mention the greater security for these areas if the locations were being used? It is much easier to know who is there for our police then to patrol vast vacant structures. Second, to grow the tax base I plan to work along side Commissioner Rick Causer and Public Works director Tim Thornberry helping Causers plan to bring people back in the city by petition, giving the option for Chattanooga Residents in the surrounding area to be apart of Red Bank, for some once again. This will work. Red Banks taxes give enough incentive and that is why we must not raise our taxes again. Third, but definitely not last, bringing business in, beautifying the drive down Dayton Blvd, and expanding the tax base without raising taxes on existing citizens, we could flip how others view Red Bank making it a prime location to buy property and invest in a soon to be thriving city. This all comes back to a Proactive Commission, how hard we are willing to work, how well we work together and that is why I ask for your vote to work on the board as your District 3 Commissioner bringing the energy and the love for this city to the chair, representing you and bringing change to unite us not only as a city but a great community.
