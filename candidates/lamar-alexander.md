q1: The new health care law is adding costs that destroy jobs and increase premiums. We need to repair the damage of Obamacare and prevent further damage.
q2: To repair the damage Obamacare has done, we should replace it with step-by-step reforms that increase freedom and choice and reduce the cost of health insurance. For example, we should allow people to purchase insurance across state lines and allow small businesses to pool together so they can buy insurance for their employees. Step-by-step reforms like these will not only lower health insurance costs. They will make it easier for Americans to find a good job since job creators will find it less expensive to create new jobs.
q3: Both the Islamic State and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa are grave threats to our national security.
q4: The United States needs to project strength on the international stage while weighing carefully the costs of getting involved in any more prolonged conflicts in the Middle East or elsewhere.
q5: What we need from President Obama is a clear military plan – instead of a political plan – for destroying the Islamic State and stopping its 4th-century brand of barbarism. The president should consult with military leaders and present a plan to Congress to consider.
q6: I have suggested four grand principles to help us chart a competitive energy future for our country. Those principles are 1) cheaper, not more expensive, energy; 2) clean, not just renewable, energy; 3) research and development, not government mandates; 4) free market, not government picking "winners and losers."
q7: The best thing we can do to protect our environment is focus on the principles I’ve stated above while working to double government-sponsored energy research and allowing our free enterprise system to create an abundance of clean, cheap, reliable energy.
q8: Our country’s border security is a mess.
q9: First, we need to secure the border. Then we need to end the perpetual amnesty for the more than 11 million people who are already here and treat them as we would those who break the law: find them and fine them. I voted in 2013 to secure the border and end amnesty.
q10: Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. We need to fix the federal government’s nearly $18 trillion debt, and that’s why Senator Corker and I have proposed legislation that would reduce the growth of out-of-control entitlement spending by nearly $1 trillion.
q11: The main reason it is so hard for our free enterprise system to create jobs is that the federal government has imposed so many costs and regulations on job creators – from Obamacare to new taxes. We need to liberate our free enterprise system from many of the Obama administration’s rules and regulations.
q12: Our greatest challenge is raising family incomes. It is too hard to find a job today because it has become too hard to create new jobs.
