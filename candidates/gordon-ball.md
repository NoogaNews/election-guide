q1: Everyone deserves healthcare. Back in 1995, I had a heart attack. A month later, I had another one. That was nineteen (19) years ago. I???m healthy now. Of course, the medical bills piled up, but unlike many Americans, I had good health insurance and was also financially able to handle the enormous costs of medical care. However, many American families are financially ruined by catastrophic medical situations, which push them over the economic cliff. In the 21st century, American families should not have to choose between feeding, clothing and sheltering their children, or taking them to the doctor.
q2: I'll fight to end the antitrust exemption for health insurance companies regarding the Affordable Care Act ???an exemption that currently allows insurance companies the luxury of not having to compete for business, resulting in higher premiums for American consumers.
q3: Terrorism, domestic and abroad, is a huge threat and has been since the 1972 Olympics. The biggest long term national security threat is our debt that we owe to china.
q4: We are part of a global community and that is the reality. I would put the oxygen mask on our country first and make sure we are breathing. Think about it, if we had the money back from the Iraq war we could build a school in every county of the country.
q5: I agree with my congressman jimmy Duncan, that appropriate steps were taken and there should be no boots on the ground should be utilized by the US.
q6: Invest in a Manhattan style project for the next 20 years that includes wind, solar, nuclear,and coal and build the keystone pipeline. We must prepare for the generations to come by using all the options available to us.
q7: 90% of reputable scientist say climate change is a problem, if they are to be believed, we must curb our emissions, but to do so without other industrial countries agreement is senseless.
q8: We need to secure our borders more probably, and not just the southern border.
q9: I do not believe in Amnesty. I do think there needs to be a fair and clear path for immigrants in this country to obtain citizenship and laws are in place to do that, but it needs to also be fair to taxpayers and legal immigrants.
q10: We have to quit giving tax exemptions to corporations such as the oil industry and Wall Street. And it is imperative that we crack down on wasteful spending.
q11: Total restructuring of our tax system, which if properly done could create 1 million good paying jobs to rebuild our infrastructure for the 21st century. This must be a bi-partisan effort.
q12: We need a balanced budget.
