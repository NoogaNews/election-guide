bio: I am the 2014 Constitution Party candidate for Governor of Tennessee.<br><br>I was born and raised in Union City, TN. As a kid, I was challenged by my parents and peers to be all that I could be. As a teenager, I was invited by a friend in high school to go and worship God. I attended worship faithfully for one year hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ ringing in my ears and resting in my soul. In October of 1988, I was born again as a disciple of Jesus Christ. It was this experience that would forever change my life. I continue to sit at the Master's feet to learn and to utilize the talents that He has given me.<br><br>I graduated from Union City High School and proceeded to the University of Tennessee at Martin where I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1995. From there I furthered my studies and obtained my Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.) from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1999.<br><br>After graduating from veterinary school, I began a career as a small animal veterinarian. I have lived and worked in many cities throughout this great state of Tennessee. I have been an associate veterinarian, relief veterinarian, emergency room veterinarian and now an owner of a veterinary hospital.<br><br>I became involved in politics in 2008 after the Banker Bailout Act (i.e. TARP, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) was passed. It was at this point that I realized that the Republican Party for which I championed as the only conservative party was a fraud because they gave 700 billion dollars or more of your money to big failed banks and insurance companies. We heard the term "too big to fail." I know that it was our conservative Republicans that failed us. I am now a member and vice-Chairman of the Constitution Party of Tennessee. As a candidate I am committed to the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Tennessee as well as to our party platform which I hope you will read and consider at www.cpotn.com Unlike the two major parties we hold our elected accountable.
