q1: I believe Collegedale has a lot going for it. I also think it could be said that Collegedale is suffering from a small identity crisis at the moment. Can anyone tell me where the center of the city is? It is time for the city to develop a true center and a vibrant core; a place where people of all ages can gather and share a real sense of community. I'd like to help make that happen.<br><br>I know the ballots have already been printed and its too late to take my name off the ticket...but I would if I could. I'm willing to get involved and would like to help the city of Collegedale grow in a good and responsible way. I'm realizing that I need to focus my time on my family and my business for now. That being said...I endorse Ethan White and encourage all who were supporting me to cast your vote for Ethan.
