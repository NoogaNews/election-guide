bio: I have lived in the town almost 40 years.  I have raised my family here and taught school here.  I've served on the Town Council for 8 years.  As a council member, I have worked hard to master the learning curve to serve my town to the best of my ability.  And, after 8 years, I'm pretty good at my job.

q1: Our Town Council has accomplished so much. The $7.3 million school is on track to be paid off in two years and we anticipate a property tax reduction for our citizens and a savings of almost $1 million in interest. We've been awarded a AA Bond Rating from Moody's. We've been named by Bloomberg Business Week as "One of the best places in the Nation to raise a family;" by Movoto as "the Number One place to live in Tennessee," and we're ranked as "one of the top ten safest small towns in America." Signal Mountain is a great place to live! Re-elect our council and we'll keep it that way.
q2: We are experiencing growth pressure as is the rest of Hamilton County, which expects upward of 80,000 new residents in the next 10 years. Growth can be good, but it can also mean over-crowded schools, congestion, the need for additional public facilities, resources, infrastructure, and higher taxes. We can't just wait for it to happen. We must be proactive and prepared to accommodate it.
q3: We need to update and review our 2008 Land Use Plan.  Identify specific problems likely to result from additional growth, and we need to begin now working together to ensure good sustainable growth that will maintain the quality of life we enjoy here.
