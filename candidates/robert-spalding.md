q1: I grew up on Signal. I have a lifelong track record d of improving Signal Mountain since age 15 .I was educated locally. I am the only candidate with a storefront business on Signal. I have a strong business background locally and nationally. I have 42 years of publics safety experience that will help guide infrastructure decisions on the council. Our Town Charter has some serious flaws that fail to allow referendums for charge issues like the land trust and our business are losing traction by prohibitive ordinances that need modifications to assist our community in getting new ideas that facilitate information flow with a centralized electronic bulletins boards near town hall to promote issues and events and weather delays.<br><br>I have tremendous local community involvement with WRES and the HCSD that greatly improves our community safety.
q2: Weakness in our Town Charter to allow referendums on upcoming future issues, like previous highly charged annexation issues, the land trust other highly charged issues so the majority is fairly represented<br><br>Passing Ordinances that are friendly to businesses and allowing you more of your property lines to allow for different floor plans and our aging public get older to be able to seek variances to modify their older homes to live longer without leaving their residences<br><br>Making sure a SRO program never gets dropped on the back of kids like this council did and make sure it always stays funded and fully supported at all levels of our town government<br><br>Making sure our revenue matches our spending and we conserve our budget to meet expenses
q3: Modify our Town Charter to help close loopholes for any majority to be fairly represented by referendums when necessary<br><br>Change our ordinances to be more business friendly and more ordnances that support property rights with what you can do with your property and not what you cant do with your property <br><br>Be proactive in meeting our finance goals by addressing growth and infrastructure maintenance issues and the meeting the challenges of the funding our part of the WWTA<br><br>Get Hodgepodge back on the mountain after loosing it to poor governmental management after enjoying that festival for 41 years.. it is a good example of letting good volunteers act in and autonomous manner without government micromanaging volunteer groups<br><br>Finding multiple sources of local funding for programs that are in part shared concepts or county in nature  before they as suddenly dropped
