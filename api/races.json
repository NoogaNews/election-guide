As a kid, I was challenged by my parents and peers to be all that I could be. As a teenager, I was invited by a friend in high school to go and worship God. I attended worship faithfully for one year hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ ringing in my ears and resting in my soul. In October of 1988, I was born again as a disciple of Jesus Christ. It was this experience that would forever change my life. I continue to sit at the Master???s feet to learn and to utilize the talents that He has given me.<br><br>I graduated from Union City High School and proceeded to the University of Tennessee at Martin where I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1995. From there I furthered my studies and obtained my Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.) from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1999.<br><br>After graduating from veterinary school, I began a career as a small animal veterinarian. I have lived and worked in many cities throughout this great state of Tennessee. I have been an associate veterinarian, relief veterinarian, emergency room veterinarian and now an owner of a veterinary hospital.<br><br>I became involved in politics in 2008 after the Banker Bailout Act (i.e. TARP, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) was passed. It was at this point that I realized that the Republican Party for which I championed as the only conservative party was a fraud because they gave 700 billion dollars or more of your money to big failed banks and insurance companies. We heard the term ???too big to fail???. I know that it was our conservative Republicans that failed us. I am now a member and vice-Chairman of the Constitution Party of Tennessee. As a candidate I am committed to the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Tennessee as well as to our party platform which I hope you will read and consider at www.cpotn.com Unlike the two major parties we hold our elected accountable.",

Hospitals suffer a financial loss on a daily basis, health care workers are threatened with layoffs, and residents of rural communities are losing access to healthcare.

They must travel with the U.S. Military branch from the time that unit or command leaves the United States soil, be with them on tours while in harms way, and experience the very lifestyle that our service men and women experience for months and years.

I feel for these people and their family's, but they went to an area that they KNEW was dangerous!! Look, how many American tourist and Missionaries have been taken hostage, murdered, or flat out disappeared in South American countries by drug cartels and rebels or both!?!?

I remember as a young teen in south central Illionois, we would get snow every year. Now, it's nothing one season and a crap load the next. Our weather patterns are changing. Now, has it been induced by man's pollution, or is it the natural cycle of things?  Or maybe a little of both. I do know one thing, they have figured out how to attached \"money\" to this eco phenom.....carbon credits!! The minute money got attached to this environmental issue, I new it was going to get taken to the extreme, and I think that is exactly what is happening.

Most of the gentleman that are here on work visas have no desire to become American citizens. They simply are here to work and send the money home to where ever that is, and that is fine. But the point is, they are here working legally. It didn't require that much effort on their part to obtain the necessary paperwork. The few that wish to become American citizens, have applied for citizenship, paid the six hundred and something dollars, take the night courses (on top of working a full week), and are learning ENGLISH. I have all the respect in the world for these men, the ones that are here just to work and the ones that want to be Americans.

Besides implementing a flat tax system, what I would like to do is have an independent audit performed on the government books. NOT the GAO, not a B.S. congressional panel or senate committee.....an honest to goodness independent accounting agency from \"no-wheres-ville, North Dakota\" with NO political ties or interests to create a good ole fashion spread-sheet of the black and red numbers of the cash coming in and the cash going out. Every agency, every department, every red cent would be accounted for. And once that is complete and findings are presented to the American tax payer, let the slashing begin!!

We MUST put into place a flat tax system that everybody pays their fair share (hey.....the supreme court said that corporations are people too :), relieve the stress on small businesses and the middle class and then I think we would start to see an improvement in the overall economy."

We need to build upon these, but there are changes that can be made to not only lower costs but to also provide patients with the care that they need, want, and deserve. A government run health insurance program, however, is not the answer. It would take control away from the doctors, threaten employer-sponsored health insurance, and limit individual choices. Government run health insurance simply does not work.",
        "q2": "I believe that America???s health care system is worth saving. I believe that its problems can be resolved in such a way that no one loses their current health insurance or the right to choose their own doctor. Our solutions, however, must be made in a fiscally responsible manner so that affordable health care can be expanded to include both early detection and prevention, yet not limit patient choice and patient-doctor control.<br><br>Malpractice law, as an example, must be reformed to eliminate both excessive medical liability costs and frivolous lawsuits. Additionally, we must ensure that reimbursement to providers is at levels that will allow them to provide continued care to their patients.",
        "q3": "Nuclear proliferation and cyber attacks both pose significant threats to the security of our nation. Cyber attacks, while a fairly new threat, should not be underestimated. The unique challenges posed by cyber attacks require foresight, innovation, and strong intelligence from our agencies. Other nations are already working tirelessly to improve their defense against cyber attacks??? we cannot afford to be a step behind.",
        "q4": "The U.S. must increase its presence on the international stage, assuming more leadership in directing policy, as well as partnering with our friends across the globe in defending democracy, supporting economic growth, and aiding in world health initiatives.",

        "q6": "It is imperative to our national security that the United States becomes energy independent. In order to do so, comprehensive energy legislation is needed, with particular attention given to environmentally safe energy exploration in Alaska???s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve (ANWR) and the Outer Continental Shelf.<br><br>Nuclear power is a safe, effective, and environmentally friendly way to produce energy for our country. Greater reliance on nuclear power will result in a reduction of imported oil from nations friendly to terrorists. Nuclear power creates jobs, provides large amounts of energy at a time when energy costs are so high, and strengthens our national security and economic stability. A critical provider of American nuclear power is our own Anderson County, specifically Oak Ridge.",
        "q7": "It is critical that we pursue more environmentally-friendly methods of producing gas and oil. We must also further the development of clean coal power and the expansion of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar power. Simply put, we can employ common sense and innovation to meet our current and future energy needs.",

I understand firsthand that small businesses are responsible for creating 80% of all the new jobs in our country during the last 20 years. In order for our economy to rebound during this current economic crisis, we need strong job growth, which I believe will correspond directly with small business growth. We do not need more government intervention. The government???s excessive spending must be curbed, coupled with policies that promote investment into American businesses which are the key to rejuvenating our economy and jump starting job growth.",
        "q12": "The biggest problem facing our economy is Washington's excessive spending. The national debt must be reined in. The government???s massive spending to stem the tide of rising unemployment has proven to be counterproductive. Rather, the adoption of policies that promote business investment, lower taxes and reduce the regulatory burdens on business will turn our economy around and create sustainable jobs."

Push-notifications would be available to alert citizens of road closures, weather conditions, and events taking place in the city.

Collegedale is expected to experience major growth over the next coming years. It is imperative that we as a city have a vision and a plan in place now, not later, which addresses this growth. If elected I will work to ensure the city is prepared for this growth now by being intentional about our growth. This includes expanding and improving our commercial design standards, working with land owners to make sure the development that comes to Collegedale is something which will complement the city, and working hard to bring businesses to Collegedale which improve the living standards of our residents.<br><br>3. Protecting the integrity of Collegedale. Collegedale is and will continue to be an amazing place to raise a family; founded on home town value the city respects and prides themselves on.

        "q1": "While considering the decision to run back in late February it became apparent to me that Red Bank was in need of a makeover. That is when i decided to run for Commissioner of District 3. I feel that it is the best service to give to the city that I now live in to represent the citizens and my community while bringing new and youthful ideas. Red Bank is in a very unique situation due its low taxes and its proximity to the North Shore area making it the next destination to look when searching for a new home, with the right commission sitting on the board, a proactive commission, there are only great things to come for the City.",
        "q2": "The three most important issues to me as the District 3 candidate are fairly simple. The first is the city has so much empty space, space that could be used to create and foster up and coming business. The second is that we must build the tax base for the City. Don't worry, this does not mean raising taxes! The third, to change the perception of this great city to attract more families, buyers, and business. Every decision that is made from the board is important, every single one.",
        "q3": "To begin, I have stated in public on several different occasions that I would like to start an incubator program within the city, bringing home occupations  to store fronts and creating a home for entrepreneurs in the surrounding area. As a bored member I will work tirelessly to strike a deal with the property owners of these empty space to allow the very low cost of using this space, charging entrepreneurs no more that one hundred and fifty dollars a month and the cost of utilities. As a board we must not halt business but find it in ourselves to do what we can to help it thrive. I believe that after a deal is struck, we will have no problem filling these spaces giving residents and outsiders coming in new places to shop, spend money and help support local business. Did I mention the greater security for these areas if the locations were being used? It is much easier to know who is there for our police then to patrol vast vacant structures. Second, to grow the tax base I plan to work along side Commissioner Rick Causer and Public Works director Tim Thornberry helping Causers plan to bring people back in the city by petition, giving the option for Chattanooga Residents in the surrounding area to be apart of Red Bank, for some once again. This will work. Red Banks taxes give enough incentive and that is why we must not raise our taxes again. Third, but definitely not last, bringing business in, beautifying the drive down Dayton Blvd, and expanding the tax base without raising taxes on existing citizens, we could flip how others view Red Bank making it a prime location to buy property and invest in a soon to be thriving city. This all comes back to a Proactive Commission, how hard we are willing to work, how well we work together and that is why I ask for your vote to work on the board as your District 3 Commissioner bringing the energy and the love for this city to the chair, representing you and bringing change to unite us not only as a city but a great community.",

        "q3": "1. Road paving, striping, reflectors, clearing, culverts, litter pick-up, etc. are already functions mandated by our Town charter, so we encourage reports of any particular problem so it can be solved promptly. The dangerous intersection at the top of the W Rd. and unwarranted closures of the W are two issues I would personally like to work on. Years ago a stream was diverted causing ice on the W and consequently causing the road to be closed too frequently. I think some cooperation with a water engineer and the sheriff's department could remedy the situation, and we can find more answers for safety at the top of the W. I pledge to take these on if elected.<br><br>2. Taxes are always of vital concern. My basic principle is to preserve Walden's quality of life in the most fiscally responsible way possible. I want to keep our taxes low in Walden, which leads to the next answer.<br><br>3. Walden is currently supporting three municipal buildings. All need good roofs, water and electric service, insurance coverage, etc. Walden also has some land in prime locations on Taft Highway. What if we were to sell the unused land and the building fronting Taft? Not only would we consolidate our assets into only two municipal buildings, but also we would generate tax revenue. We could turn non-income producing government property into income generating commercial property. Once our assets are consolidated, we would have fewer expenses and more revenue. Then we can better handle renovations and maintenance to the community centers and the playground, and perhaps have some left over for fire protection, while keeping taxes low. Please call me at 886-4568 or write karenstone@waldenhouse.com to discuss any of these points.",
